# OptiRide_ETL
A Data Engineering toolkit for transforming raw bike-share and weather data into clean, structured form for data-driven decisions.


OptiRide is a New Yorkâ€“based data toolkit for the bike-sharing ecosystem. It ingests real-time feeds on station capacity, bike availability, and weather, but transforming this raw, fragmented, and multi-source data into clean, structured datasets remains challenging. This project aims to tackle these challenges, providing reliable, well-structured information that enables analysis, actionable insights, and data-driven decisions for improved urban mobility
